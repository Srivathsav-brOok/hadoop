Hello World
MapReduce is a programming model for processing large data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster.
A key concept of the MapReduce framework is the partitioning of the input data set into independent chunks which are processed by the map tasks in a completely parallel manner.
The framework sorts the outputs of the maps, which are then input to the reduce tasks.
Typically both the input and the output of the job are stored in a file-system.
The framework takes care of scheduling tasks, monitoring them and re-executes the failed tasks.
